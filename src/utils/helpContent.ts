  INITIAL_VIDEO_IDEA: `Extremely Entertaining, or Extremely Useful?
- Good videos are either extremely useful, or extremely entertaining. The best videos are both.
- If you're being useful, frame it about the problem you solve, not the method you use to do it

Does the concept match my audience?
- My audience is 90% male, between the ages of 25 to 45, who share an equal interest in traditional outdoors experiences and technology. What's yours? (Check Youtube Analytics)
- How well does the video topic fit into your chosen niche(s)?

Does the concept add value?
- Is this a concept that hasn't been covered in-depth already by other Youtubers or yourself?
- If it has, does it add elements or do it in a way to make it more valuable?
- Is the value of a video based on a prerequisite? (eg, only helpful for people who own an Xbox) The more prerequisites you introduce, the further you restrict your potential audience
- Do you know enough about the subject to add to the conversation?
- Is the core element interesting enough to be worthwhile? (eg, no one cares what some rando youtuber has in their movie collection)`,

  SCRIPT: `Framing
- What emotion do you want the viewer to feel by the end of the video? (eg confident, happy, angry, etc)
- What will be surprising to the viewer? (crush expectations & assumptions)
- For intensity, focus on the most pertinent information. Keep irrelevant banter to a minimum.
- Keep info relevant to the main concept
- Validate viewer's potential pre-conceived notions

Structure
- Get the viewer's attention immediately (but don't be obnoxious)
- Brief reminder to subscribe right before intro card, then a more in-depth one at the end
- Pyramid format:
  - First tier: Key info & answer to primary question
  - Second tier: Who, what, when, where, why, and how, primary points of conversation
  - Third tier: Go in depth on each point of conversation, then conclusion

Style
- Be yourself; fake personalities are easy to spot
- Take the core characteristics of your personality and try to magnify them

Marketing Principles
- Giving Gifts: Giving free info, giveaways, frame video as you helping out
- Baby Steps: Increments of expectations, gradually introduce new concepts
- Popularity: More popular subjects get stronger traction quickly
- Credibility: Only talk about things you are familiar with/do yourself
- Scarcity: Niche into content that can't be gotten elsewhere
- Honesty: Be up-front with affiliates, sponsorship, and what you stand to gain
- Rapport: Build channel history & consistent expectations of content
- Urgency: Exploding offers, deadlines, act now, limited duration (if relevant)
- Greed: Things in viewer's best interests, good value/deals
- Fear of Loss: Things viewer can't lose out on; important knowledge/facts
- Belonging: Don't alienate viewers. Build a community of like minds.
- Curiosity: Thumbnail & title to create curiosity in viewer`,

  RECORDING: `Speaking
- Breathing: Deep breaths for power behind narration
- Sit straight to not artificially limit pitch variation
- Use pacing, volume, & intonation to create emphasis & avoid monotony
- Leave pauses between points of conversation
- Remember that you're telling a story, not reading a powerpoint
- Let my passion for the subject show through
- Viewer is part of the conversation/adventure

Audio & Video Quality
- Audio quality is the most important. Focus on making sure this is solved first. Viewers will watch your video if it has excellent audio quality, regardless if the video is potato quality (though it certainly affects it). No background noise, no tinny compressed audio
- 4k is quickly becoming the standard, but for now 1080p is still fine

Elements to emulate:
- Study the Youtubers you most enjoy. What is it about them that you enjoy? Don't copy them on the surface, understand what the driving principles are underneath that make them so popular. Are they charismatic? Absolutely hilarious? Can you replicate these principles without having to fake it?`,

  EDITING: `Show, don't tell
- Actions over words. Demonstrating something working is much better than trying to convince them with arguments

Length
- Length should scale with utility. For less interesting/useful videos, aim for around 4-5 mins; more interesting ones, aim for around ten
- For longer videos, aim for around 45 minutes per video
- For multi-video series, break at natural points (such as the end of the day during a backpacking trip)
- Cut out dead space; there should be no hanging points of dead air
- Reduce end-of-video call to actions & administrative stuff (improves watch time)`,
